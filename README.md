This is a challenge pack which kills you every 10 seconds. For each advancement you unlock, the time you can stay alive extends by 1 second.  

**Some other details:**  
- Since there are 122 advancements in Minecraft (technically 124, but this pack doesn't include those), the maximum time you can stay alive is 132 seconds. This will obviously extend as Mojang adds more advancements to the game.
- Keep inventory is enabled on world load to make this a little more possible.
- This doesn't work with custom advancements.

**Compatibility:**

Explanation: Versions highlighted with orange will partially function, but some modified advancements will not work.

For example, wax on and wax off will not work due to looking for invalid blocks (new copper blocks in 1.21.9) in any version before 1.21.9.
